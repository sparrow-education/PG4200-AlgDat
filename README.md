## Attention ⚠️: Question 1.1
### The formula for calculating the address: `memory address = base address + data type * i`
### That will be memory address = 1022 + 2 * 1704 = 4430
### But the 1704 is a value and not index.
### So to calculate index position to 1704 is 1704 - 1300, since 1300 is index 0 = 404
### `memory address = 1022 + 2 * 404 = 1830` is the "correct" answer as per request.
